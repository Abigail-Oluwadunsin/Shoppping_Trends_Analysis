 # Project Overview
 This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to identify trends in purchasing patterns. The goal was to understand how customers interact with products and how their preferences change over time.

 # Problem Statement
 Retail businesses need to understand customer behavior in order to improve product offerings and sales strategies. This project answers questions such as:
 What products are purchased most frequently?
 Are there noticeable shopping trends over time?
 How do customer preferences vary?

 # Tools Used  
 Power Query (Data Cleaning and Transformation)
 Power BI (Data visualization and dashboard creation)

 # What I did
 I cleaned and structured the data to ensure accuracy. I then analyzed purchasing trends and customer behavior using Power BI and created dashboards to visualize product popularity and trend changes.

 # Key Insights
 Popular Product Categories: Footwear and Clothing are among the top contributors to revenue, with both categories maintaining average review ratings 
 Customer purchasing patterns changed over time, showing clear trends.
 Some products had steady demand while others fluctuated significantly.

 # Recommendations
 Prioritize Products with Consistent Demand: Products that show steady purchasing patterns should be given priority in stocking and availability to meet customer demand consistently.
 Adjust inventory based on observed purchasing patterns:Inventory levels should be reviewed regularly to avoid overstocking slow-moving items.
 Use customer behavior insights to improve promotions:Insights from shopping trends can help design promotions that align with customer preferences, increasing the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
 Monitor trends regularly to respond to changes in preferences:Understanding which products perform well can guide decisions around pricing, product placement, and marketing strategy.
